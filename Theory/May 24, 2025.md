## 1. How a Rod Radiates Electromagnetic Energy

A simple conductor such as a metallic rod can radiate electromagnetic waves when an alternating current (AC) is applied to it. The fundamental mechanism of radiation lies in the time-varying nature of the current along the conductor. 

When a high-frequency AC is passed through the rod, it causes the electrons to oscillate back and forth. This movement of charge generates a time-varying current, which produces a time-varying electric field. A changing electric field gives rise to a magnetic field, and vice versa, forming a propagating electromagnetic wave according to Maxwell's equations.

The radiation occurs primarily due to the **change in current density** over time and along the length of the rod. If the rod length is on the order of half the wavelength of the current signal, it becomes a highly efficient radiator—this forms the basis of the half-wave dipole antenna.

Key Point:
- No radiation occurs if the current is uniform and non-time-varying.
- Radiation is strongest when current changes both spatially and temporally.

## 2. Transmission Line and Directed Radiation

A transmission line (e.g., coaxial cable or parallel wire) is designed to carry electromagnetic energy from one point to another with minimal loss and without radiating energy into space. It confines electromagnetic waves within its structure.

However, when the end of a transmission line is modified or terminated in a certain way, such as flaring it open, it can be made to radiate. This process leads to the design of horn antennas.

- A **horn antenna** is essentially a waveguide that flares outward to match the impedance of free space. This gradual transition helps direct the radiation in a preferred direction and reduces reflection.
- The flaring helps transition from guided wave to radiated wave, and the directionality depends on the shape and size of the flare.

## 3. Dipole Antenna: Definition and Radiation Mechanism

A **dipole antenna** consists of two conductive elements aligned end-to-end with a small gap between them, where the feed (usually a coaxial cable) is connected.

Radiation occurs due to the oscillating currents in the dipole arms. The field lines spread out and form a radiation pattern. The dipole has a characteristic doughnut-shaped radiation pattern, with maximum radiation occurring perpendicular to the axis of the dipole and nulls along the axis.

For a half-wave dipole:
- Length of each arm: $$ \frac{\lambda}{4} $$
- Total length: $$ \frac{\lambda}{2} $$

The radiated power can be modeled using the Poynting vector:
$$
\vec{S} = \vec{E} \times \vec{H}
$$

## 4. Isotropic Antenna and Radiation Parameters

An **isotropic antenna** is a hypothetical point source that radiates uniformly in all directions. It is used as a reference for defining antenna performance.

**Radiation Intensity (U):**
$$
U(\theta, \phi) = r^2 S_r(\theta, \phi)
$$
where $ S_r $ is the radial component of the Poynting vector.

**Total Radiated Power (P_rad):**
$$
P_{rad} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{\pi} U(\theta, \phi) \sin \theta d\theta d\phi
$$

## 5. Radiation Patterns: Lobes, Side Lobes, and Nulls

A radiation pattern is a graphical representation of the radiation properties of the antenna as a function of space coordinates.

- **Main lobe**: The direction of maximum radiation.
- **Side lobes**: Secondary lobes other than the main lobe. These are undesirable as they waste power and may cause interference.
- **Nulls**: Directions in which radiation is minimal or zero.

These patterns can be analyzed using the **Fourier Transform** of the current distribution on the antenna.

## 6. HPBW and FNBW

- **HPBW (Half Power Beam Width)**: Angular width of the main lobe where the radiation power is at least 50% (-3 dB) of the maximum.
$$
\text{HPBW} = \theta_2 - \theta_1, \quad \text{where } U(\theta_1) = U(\theta_2) = 0.5 U_{max}
$$

- **FNBW (First Null Beam Width)**: Angular separation between the first nulls on either side of the main lobe.

These parameters describe the **directionality** and **resolution** of the antenna.

## 7. Gain and Directivity

- **Directivity (D):**
$$
D = \frac{4\pi U_{max}}{P_{rad}}
$$
Measures how focused the radiation is compared to an isotropic antenna.

- **Gain (G):**
$$
G = \eta D
$$
Accounts for antenna losses (e.g., resistance, imperfect matching). $ \eta $ is the radiation efficiency.

## 8. S-Parameters in Antenna Design

In RF engineering, antennas are treated as 2-port networks using scattering (S) parameters.

- **S11**: Reflection coefficient at the input port. A measure of how much power is reflected due to impedance mismatch.
$$
S_{11} = \frac{V_{reflected}}{V_{incident}}
$$

A low S11 (e.g., -10 dB or less) indicates a good match and efficient power transfer.

S-parameters are plotted over frequency to evaluate how the antenna behaves across a band.

## 9. Beamwidth vs Bandwidth

- **Beamwidth**: Angular range over which the antenna radiates significantly (described by HPBW or FNBW).
- **Bandwidth**: Frequency range over which the antenna maintains acceptable performance (e.g., S11 < -10 dB, acceptable gain).

These are independent metrics: an antenna may have a narrow beamwidth (high directivity) but operate over a wide bandwidth.

## 10. Patch Antenna

A **patch antenna** consists of:
- A flat rectangular metal patch
- A dielectric substrate (e.g., FR4)
- A ground plane beneath the substrate

It resonates when the length of the patch is approximately half the wavelength of the desired frequency.

**Design Equations (for micro-strip patch):**

1. **Patch Width (W):**
$$
W = \frac{c}{2f} \sqrt{\frac{2}{\varepsilon_r + 1}}
$$

2. **Effective Dielectric Constant ($\varepsilon_{eff}$):**
$$
\varepsilon_{eff} = \frac{\varepsilon_r + 1}{2} + \frac{\varepsilon_r - 1}{2} \left(1 + 12\frac{h}{W}\right)^{-1/2}
$$

3. **Length Extension ($\Delta L$):**
$$
\Delta L = 0.412h \cdot \frac{(\varepsilon_{eff} + 0.3)(\frac{W}{h} + 0.264)}{(\varepsilon_{eff} - 0.258)(\frac{W}{h} + 0.8)}
$$

4. **Patch Length (L):**
$$
L = \frac{c}{2f\sqrt{\varepsilon_{eff}}} - 2\Delta L
$$

**Considerations:**
- The ground plane must extend beyond the patch to reduce back radiation.
- Impedance matching is critical to minimise S11.

## Ra-domes

A **ra-dome** is a structural, weatherproof enclosure that protects an antenna from the environment. It is made of a material that is transparent to the antenna’s operating frequencies.

Purpose:
- Protects antenna from rain, wind, dust, and mechanical damage
- Minimizes aerodynamic drag in airborne systems

Material Selection:
- Low-loss, low-permittivity materials (e.g., Teflon, fiberglass) that minimally affect signal propagation

Design must ensure:
- No significant signal reflection or attenuation
- Minimal impact on the antenna's radiation pattern
